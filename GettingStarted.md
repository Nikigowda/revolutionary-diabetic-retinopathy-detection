Setup Instructions:

Install Dependencies: Install the required packages using pip install numpy pandas matplotlib torch tkinter MySQL Setup: Install and set up MySQL And Configure server settings by setting the username and password. Download Project Files: Essential files required are blindness.py, model.py ,classifier.pt Database Configuration: Create a new database and table in MySQL. and Update the database configuration in the blindness.py file. Model File Configuration: Ensure the classifier.pt file is in the same directory as the project files And Update the path in the model.py file. Running the Application: Execute the blindness.py file from the terminal. This will start the GUI. Upload an image to get predictions.
